Pictures And Places is an interactive quiz game made for anyone who loves travels and geography and want to test their knowledge.
Users on this website can participate to a quiz game showing 10 questions with a related picture to each one of them. The users are requested to guess where the place shown in the picture is located, and to do that is provided with 4 possible answers. A correct or incorrect answer is going to be registered with a score tracker at the bottom left of the page so that the users can keep track of their progresses throughout the game, and at the end of it, they will receive a feedback with the score, and are given the chance to play again.

## DESIGN

### COLOUR SCHEME:

As the website is made for a geography quiz game, i wanted to give it a light and colourful mood, but still keeping it simple to provide a good user experience.

* For the quiz introduction, questions, score tracker, pop up alert background and final message text content i have used the colour  #fafafa;
    
* For the cover text i have used the colour rgb(22, 97, 72,0.9);

* For the buttons i have used the colour #000000 for the text content and #a8cccc for the background;

* For the answers, the pop up alert and all the other buttons text content i have used the colour #000000;

* For the answers buttons background colour i have used #1cd0b2;

* For the answers buttons when hovered,i have used the colour #e2f0ed;

### TYPOGRAPHY

All the fonts are imported from Google Fonts.
The Fonts imported are "Kaushan Script" and "Shadows Into Light".

* The font "Shadows Into Light" is the font i have used for the heading of the game website. Is a font that looks great for a headline,is in cursive to make it a bit lighter and i think goes well with the mood of a geography quiz game;

* The font "Kaushan Script" is the font i used for the pages paragraphs,the questions,the answers, the pop up alert and the button text content,it is as the headline font very light, and it goes well with the mood i wanted to give to the quiz game.

### IMAGERY AND VIDEOS

As the website is for a geography quiz game, i wanted to give it a backround image showing what could be a beautiful and peaceful turistic place as a tropical beach can be. I also thought that showing images of the places the user has to guess was fundamental, and makes the quiz itself much more interesting. For this purpose i used a background image and 10 different images related to each of the specific questions, the images are all from the Pexels website.

### WIREFRAMES
 
Wireframes were created for mobile,tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

The score tracker keeps track of the correct and incorrect answers provided by the user during the quiz game.
It's located on the bottom left side of the page.

### THE INFO FEEDBACK MESSAGE:

This is a pop up message that appears after the user enters an answer. This feedback message is going to tell the user if the answer entered is right or wrong, and it's going to show some infos about the place featured in the question.I decided to use a pop up alert as the game page is quite full of content itself, and i think a pop up alert keeps it quite clear and easy to read, not going in conflict with the rest of the content in the quiz game, keeping the user experience and accessibility good.

### THE GAME END MESSAGE:

The game end message, appears after the user submits the last answer, and press the finish button.
This message is made to let the user know that the quiz has been completed, and to give a feedback about the correct answers scored.
